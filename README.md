# Rewriting History: Systematic analysis of the impact of label noise correction on ML Fairness

The implementation of the label noise correction methods is in the ```label_correction.py``` file.

## Running an experiment

Run the script ```run_noiseinjection.py``` for experiments using standard ML datasets, or ```run.py``` for experiments using fairness benchmark datasets that do not require the noise injection step.

Results are saved to a new folder inside the ```experiments``` folder.

Datasets are stored to the ```data``` folder.
